### Demo

![Demo](https://github.com/kenglxn/PyramidSortSublimeTextPlugin/raw/master/demo.gif)

Sorts selected text based on line length, from shortest to longest, while cutting out empty lines

So this:

    foobar
    bazolino
    
    barolainen
    foo

Becomes:
    
    foo
    foobar
    bazolino
    barolainen


### Installing from command line

Simply clone this repository into the Packages folder of sublime. E.g:
    
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/
    git clone https://github.com/kenglxn/PyramidSortSublimeTextPlugin.git

### Alternative

There is a [SortBy package](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SortBy) available through Package Control 
that has a variety of sorting commands, including by length ascending and descending. 
If more advanced sorting is your cup of tea, then you should probably give it a look.
